# react-native-leaflet-expo

This is a fork of https://github.com/lichtmetzger/react-native-leaflet-expo

I created it because the original project does not work in Expo preview mode.

This one does, but it also __requires__ Expo. If you only use React Native without Expo, refer to the project of pavel-corsaghin.

## How to use
package.json:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-leaflet-view": "Teddir/react-native-leaflet-expo",
    ...
}
```
